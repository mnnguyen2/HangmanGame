Hangman is a 2-player word-guessing game generally played by having one player think of a word and the other player trying to guess that word letter by letter. 
The game in this repo will feature 2 versions of the game:
1. **Traditional**: A computer-versus-user version. The computer will pick a random word from a dictionary for the user to guess. The user will be allowed to guess the word until 
they get it correctly.
2. **Evil**: The evil version of the game allows the computer to change the word in order to make the user's task harder, as long as they have the same letters that the users have 
guessed correctly (and in the same position with same word length). 

To play the game, download the whole project to your IDE. Enjoy! :)
